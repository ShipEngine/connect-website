Installing the ShipEngine CLI
==================
The [ShipEngine CLI](https://github.com/ShipEngine/shipengine-integration-platform-cli/#commands) is the tool you'll use to create your [ShipEngine Integration Platform](./index.md) application, test your application,
and deploy your application to the ShipEngine Integration Platform for further testing and hosting.


Requirements
------------
Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 10 or greater per the site's instructions. Likewise, you can use other package managers, such as [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS or Linux and
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows.

Verify that [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) was installed successfully along with NodeJS by running the following command: `npm -v`.

Installation
-------------
To install the ShipEngine CLI, run the following command from your terminal:
`npm install @shipengine/integration-platform-cli -g`

Verify that the CLI was installed correctly:
`shipengine -v`
