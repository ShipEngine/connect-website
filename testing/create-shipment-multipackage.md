        Some carriers provide general-purpose fields on their labels for custom text.
        This is sometimes used for messages, like "Thank you for shopping with us!",
        or may be used to store reference data, such as account numbers, warehouse codes, etc.

        The exact location on the label depends on the carrier, as does the allowed number of fields
        and the maximum length of each field. If more fields are specified than are supported by the
        carrier, then the extra fields should be ignored. Likewise, if a field length exceeds the
        carrier's maximum length, then it should be truncated. The *actual* values that are used
        should be returned, so the caller can detect any differences.

        NOTE: These fields should NOT be used to set *named* fields on the label,
        such as "RMA Number" or "Order ID". Those should be set using the correspond
        properties of the shipment.
