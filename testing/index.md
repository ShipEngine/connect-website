Testing Your Application
================
While developing your application, it is important to run tests to verify that your project structure is in the correct format and that your code behaves as expected.

Types of Tests
------------------------------
There are multiple ways to test your application, and we suggest taking advantage of all of them to ensure the highest quality integration.

#### `shipengine start`
The `shipengine start` command is extremely useful during application development. This command launches your application in a standalone webserver where you
can then make calls to your application by interacting through a web browser.

#### `shipengine test`
The `shipengine test` command validates your application against our test suite. These tests are integration tests that represent real world, end-to-end scenarios.
Rather than calling a single, individual method, these tests may make calls to multiple method in order to construct a more realistic workflow.
For example, a single test may authenticate by calling your [`connect`](./../reference/methods/connect.md) method, create a shipment using your
[`createShipment`](./../reference/methods/create-shipment.md) method, and then use your [`cancelShipment`](./../reference/methods/cancel-shipments.md) method to
cancel the shipment.

These tests execute the entire application, so you won't be able to run this suite until you have finished implementing all the methods
in your application. For this reason, we recommend using the `shipengine start` command to perform testing during iterative development.

Once you have completed development,
this test suite can provide a higher degree of confidence that the application will work as expected when used from within one of our
e-commerce applications since this suite calls your application in the same manner in which it will be used in production.

You can find a breakdown of tests available for the Carrier App [here](./carrier-app-tests.md).

### Unit Tests
We recommend that in addition to using the `start` and `test` commands that you also you provide unit tests for your application. We don't include any
tooling or impose any restrictions on which tools you can use for writing unit tests. Here is a list of JavaScript test frameworks
that we recommend, but you can choose the tools you are most familiar with.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
* [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock)
* [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)

### Live Testing
Once you have completed local development and testing of your application, you can then [publish](./../publish.md) your app to
our development platform where you can perform live testing through one of our e-commerce applications, such as
[ShipStation](https://www.shipstation.com/), before it is promoted to our production platform.
