# Development Environment
There are many great developer tools for working with JavaScript and TypeScript. Even better, most of them are free and open source. Here are a few that we really like here at ShipEngine.

## <img src="./images/vscode.svg" alt="drawing" height="25px"/> VS Code 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free source-code editor built on open-source technology and developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git and GitHub support, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, code snippets, and code refactoring.

The `shipengine-connect init` command generates a .vscode/launch.json file if you indicate you are using VS Code as your development environment. This file is configured to allow you to run the `shipengine-connect start` command and the `shipengine-connect test` command directly from VS Code. You can select Start App from the drop-down box in the debug pane to run the `shipengine-connect start` command or select Run Tests to run the `shipengine-connect test` command.

You can set breakpoints inside your methods in VS Code to help troubleshoot issues. During iterative development, you can select Start App, execute your methods and view the breakpoints to troubleshoot application issues. When your application is complete, you can select Run Tests and use breakpoints to troubleshoot any test failures before publishing your application.

## <img src="./images/atom.svg" alt="drawing" height="25px"/> Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free and open-source text and source-code editor developed by GitHub for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in NodeJS and embedded Git support. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.

## <img src="./images/sublime-text.svg" alt="drawing" height="25px"/> Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a shareware cross-platform source-code editor with a Python application programming interface. It natively supports many programming and markup languages, and functions can be added by users via plugins which are typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.
