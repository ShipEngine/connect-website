# Publishing
You can run the `shipengine-connect publish` command to publish your application to the testing environment.

After your app is successfully published you will be given login credentials to a test instance of [ShipStation](https://ship-devss111.sslocal.com/).

You can then begin testing your application within shipstation. All logs your module makes in this test environment can be viewed by using the `shipengine-connect logs` command.
