# Forms

A part of the ShipEngine Connect platform is allowing integrations to define their own forms used for things like registering or connecting a new account, and updating settings in the case of shipping integrations. These forms are defined using a library call `rect-jsonschema-form` and are comprised of two parts, a `JsonSchema` and a `UiSchema`.
