# Forms

A part of the ShipEngine Connect platform is allowing integrations to define
their own forms used for things like registering or connecting a new account.
These forms are defined using the [react-jsonschema-form](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) syntax, and are comprised of two parts, a `JsonSchema` and a `UiSchema`.
