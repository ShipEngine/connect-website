# Native Documents

The cross-platform Rendering service allows you to render native documents (such as labels and customs) into Pdf, Png and Zpl formats, using templates created in Documents Designer (Windows application).  

The `@shipengine/connect-rendering-client` provides carrier integrators with the ability to use the Rendering Service.

## Usage

This example shows you how to render the native documents via `CreateLabel` method.

```typescript
import {CreateLabelRequest, CreateLabelResponse} from '@shipengine/connect-carrier-api';
import {getDocuments, RenderingRequest} from '@shipengine/connect-rendering-client';

export const CreateLabel = async (request: CreateLabelRequest): Promise<CreateLabelResponse> => {
    return await getDocuments(request.metadata.carrier_code, request);
}
```
### Document Template

Your app definition must contain a document template file. The carrier metadata specifies the location of the file:

```typescript
export const DemoCarrier: Carrier = {
  /.../
  DocumentTemplate: join(__dirname, '../../../assets/templates/demo_carrier_code.carrier')
}
```
You can use the Documents Designer visual tool to design a document template file.  
See the page: [Documents Designer](./documents-designer/documents-designer.md).

*To get access to Rendering Service and Documents Designer please reach out to your business contact with Auctane or the [ShipEngine Connect Team](mailto:connect@shipengine.com).*

### Rendering Service

The environment variable `RENDERING_HOST` must be set for the ShipEngine Connect testing environment.  

Before run `connect publish` you have to set the variable indicating the correct host url `{rendering_service_url}` (that can be obtained from Auctane):

```bash
connect env:set RENDERING_HOST={rendering_service_url}
```
In order to use Native Documents in production, you have to add the `RENDERING_HOST` environment variable to the module's helm `values.yaml` file:
```
environment:
  RENDERING_HOST: "#{RENDERING_HOST}"
```
The value will be substituted by the deployment tool, according to environment where the module is deployed to.
