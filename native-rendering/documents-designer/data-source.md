# Data source

While creating a document template, you can access the data model using [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) syntax. You can use both, the dot notation:

```code
$.shipment.tracking_number
```
or the bracket notation:

```code
$['shipment']['tracking_number']
```

For each document you need to select DataSource property value:
**package** -  prints a label for each package in the shipment;
**shipment** - prints only one label for the whole shipment.

## Restrictions
1. Root element starts from `$.` or `.`
2. Nested object path have to start from `.` If nested object starts from `$.` it means reference to root element. In this case no relation will be considered.
3. The leading `$.` or `.` or `@` is mandatory. One of these has to be used to differentiate variables from JSONPath syntax. 
4. Special leading char `@` can be used as reference to current object with limited usage that depends on the document type, e.g. for *package* document type we can use `@package` as reference for each package in multi package shipment.
5. Keep in mind that JSONPath functions and filters (expressions) are very limited.
6. Double dots `..property` is not supported.
7. Wildcard for selecting all indexed items `[*]` can be used for arrays only and it means all items in the array.
8. Wildcard for selecting all properties `.*` at object is not supported, e.g. `shipment.*`

## Syntax

#### Data source
Data model as the source object for JSONPath examples:
```json
{
  "shipment": {
    "tracking_number": "US1234",
    "packages": [{
      "weight_details": {
        "weight_in_grams": "12"
      }
    },
    {
      "weight_details": {
        "weight_in_grams": "02"
      }
    }],
    "metadata": {
      "account.number": "1234",
      "account_enabled": "true"
    }
  }
}
```
&nbsp;

###### Properties

```code
$.shipment.tracking_number
```

###### Arrays

Items can be referenced by index (starting from zero) or asterisk in the case of aggregation functions.  
```code
$.shipment.packages[0].weight_details.weight_in_grams
Sum($.shipment.packages[*].weight_details.weight_in_grams)
$['shipment']['packages'][0]['weight_details']['weight_in_grams']
```
&nbsp;

###### Dictionaries

Generally, a dot and bracket notation can be used, but in case a dictionary key contains a dot, you have to use bracket notation - see the third example.
```code
$.shipment.metadata.account_enabled
$.shipment.metadata['account_enabled']
$.shipment.metadata['account.number']
```
&nbsp;

#### Current package reference

If you select **package** as DataSource, you can also refer to the current *Package* using prefix `@`

```code
@package.weight_details.weight_in_grams
```
