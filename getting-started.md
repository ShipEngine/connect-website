description: Learn how to begin developing your ShipEngine Integration Platform application
---

Getting Started
================

In order to add your service to the [ShipEngine Integration Platform](./index.md) and make it available within our suite of e-commerce applications,
you'll need to create a JavaScript application.

Our documentation assumes that you understand:
* Basic programming concepts
* How to use a terminal on your computer
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (_optional - you can use plain JavaScript_)

Integration Application
------------------------
ShipEngine Platform Integration applications are NPM packages that export an object matching a certain structure. Please see [our application structure guide](./structure.md) as well as our
[sample apps](https://github.com/ShipEngine/shipengine-integration-platform-sample-apps) for more information.

Your app will run in our hosted Node.js runtime environment. We take care of hosting, scaling, and providing high-availability access to your application, so you can just focus on the core functionality.


Integration Platform SDK
------------------------------------------
The [ShipEngine Integration Platform SDK](https://github.com/ShipEngine/shipengine-integration-platform-sdk) has everything you need to quickly and efficiently build an integration application.
As a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-based project, it contains all of the type definitions for every resource that will be required for your project.


Javascript vs Typescript
------------------------
The ShipEngine Integration Platform gives you the flexibility to develop your integration application in either TypeScript or JavasScript as long as it matches the required [application structure](./structure.md).
The [ShipEngine Integration Platform SDK](sdk.md) is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions to help you build your app more easily. Many editors, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/),
will automatically detect our type definitions and provide you with auto-completion and intellisense functionality â€” sometimes even if you're writing plain JavaScript.

[Our CLI](http://localhost:8080/docs/integration-platform/cli/) allows you to choose between JavaScript and TypeScript when you run the `shipengine init` command to create a new app.

If you select TypeScript, some additional configuration is
generated to facilitate your TypeScript development.
* [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) - This file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile your app. Feel
free to modify it or use it as is to begin transpiling out of the box.
* `build` script - The generated `package.json` file will include a `build` script that runs `tsc`.
* `watch` - The generated `package.json` file will include a `watch` script that runs `tsc --watch`

You will need to run `npm build` before running the `shipengine test` or `shipengine publish` command to ensure that the command is working
on the latest transpiled version of your app.


ShipEngine CLI
---------------
The [ShipEngine CLI](./cli.md) provides a variety of tools to aid you in your application development.

Use it to:
* [Scaffold a new application](create-first-app.md#create-new-project)
* [Test your application](testing/index.md)
* [Publish your application](publish.md)
