Developer Tools
=================
There are many great developer tools for working with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Even better, most of them are free and open source. Here are a few that we really like here at ShipEngine:

<div className={styles.toolList}>

![](/img/tools/vscode.svg) Visual Studio Code
----------------------------------------------
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free source-code editor built on open-source technology and developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded [Git](https://git-scm.com/_) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) support, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, code snippets, and code refactoring.

[The `connect init` command](./../cli.mdx#initialize-a-new-app) generates a `.vscode/launch.json` file if you indicate you are using VS Code as your development environment. This file is configured to allow you to run the [`connect start` command](./../cli.mdx#run-your-app-locally) and the [`connect test` command](./../cli.mdx#test-your-app) directly from VS Code. You can select `Start App` from the drop-down box in the debug
pane to run the `connect start` command or select `Run Tests` to run the `connect test` command.

You can set breakpoints inside your methods in VS Code to help troubleshoot issues. During iterative development, you can select `Start App` and use our Postman collection to execute your methods and view the breakpoints to troubleshoot application issues. When your application is complete, you can select `Run Tests` and use breakpoints to troubleshoot any test failures before [publishing](./../publish.mdx) your application.


![](/img/tools/atom.svg) Atom
----------------------------------------------
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free and open-source text and source-code editor developed by GitHub for macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows with support for plug-ins written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and embedded Git support. Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.


![](/img/tools/sublime-text.svg) Sublime Text
----------------------------------------------
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is a shareware cross-platform source-code editor with a Python application programming interface.
It natively supports many programming and markup languages, and functions can be added by users via plugins which are typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.


![](/img/tools/postman.svg) Postman
----------------------------------------------
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a collaboration platform for API development. You can use our Postman collection to perform [local testing](./../testing/index.mdx#local-testing) of your application.
