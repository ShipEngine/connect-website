Examples
--------------

```javascript
module.exports = async function trackShipment(transaction, trackingCriteria) {
  // STEP 1: Validation


  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier"s API expects

  const { trackingNumber, returns } = trackingCriteria;

  const data = {
    operation: "location_history",
    trackingNumber,
    isReturn: returns.isReturn
  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier"s API
  const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
  return await formatTrackingResponse(response.data);

}
```

```typescript
import {
  Transaction,
  TrackingCriteria,
  TrackingInfo
} from "@shipengine/platform-sdk";

export default async function trackShipment(
  transaction: Transaction, trackingCriteria: TrackingCriteria): Promise<TrackingInfo> {
  // STEP 1: Validation


  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier"s API expects

  const { trackingNumber, returns } = trackingCriteria;

  const data = {
    operation: "location_history",
    trackingNumber,
    isReturn: returns.isReturn
  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier"s API
  const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
