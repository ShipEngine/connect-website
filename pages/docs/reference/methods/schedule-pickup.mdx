```javascript

  // STEP 1: Validation

  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects

  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
  return formatConfirmation(response.data);
}
```

```typescript
