title: connect Method
description: This method is used to authenticate with your application.
---


`connect()`
===========================
This method is used to authenticate with your application. It is responsible for verifying the supplied user credentials and establishing or
  renewing a session. This session will be stored in the [`transaction`](./../transaction.mdx) object and will be passed as an argument in every subsequent method call.
  All applications must implement the connect method.


Syntax
-----------------------------------------------
<CodeWrapper>
```javascript
module.exports = async function connect(transaction, connectionFormData) {
  // Your code here
}
```

```typescript
import { Transaction } from "  @shipengine/connect-sdk";

export default async function connect(
  transaction: Transaction,
  connectionFormData: object
): Promise<void> {
  // Your code here
}
```
</CodeWrapper>



Parameters
-----------------------------------------------

#### `transaction`
A [transaction object](../transaction.mdx) containing information about the transaction and session state.

#### `connectionFormData`
The `connectionFormData` parameter is an object containing the authentication information gathered using the [connection form](../forms.mdx) you created for your application.
 It will contain whatever fields you defined in this form. Your method must then use this data to perform authentication with your backend service.




Return Value
-----------------------------------------------
#### `void`
The `connect` method does not return a value. Instead, the data that is returned in the response from calling your backend
service is used to create a `session` object that is stored in the `transaction` object that was passed as a parameter. This
`transaction` object will then be passed to every subsequent call to your application to enable your application.




Example
-----------------------------------------------
```javascript
module.exports = async function connect(transaction, connectionFormData) {
  // STEP 1: Validation
  if (!connectionFormData.agree_to_eula) {
    throw new Error(`You must agree to the terms and conditions`);
  }

  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects
  let data = {
    operation: "authenticate",
    account_id: connectionFormData.account_id,
    account_email: connectionFormData.account_email,
    account_password: connectionFormData.account_password,
    agree_to_eula: connectionFormData.agree_to_eula,
    eula: connectionFormData.eula,
  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

  // STEP 4: Store session data in the transaction.session property,
  // which is persisted across all method calls
  transaction.session = {
    id: response.data.id,
    ip: response.data.ip,
    created: response.data.created,
    language: response.data.language,
  };
}
```

```typescript
import { Transaction } from "@shipengine/connect-sdk";
import { Session } from "./session";

interface ConnectionFormData {
  account_id: string;
  account_email: string;
  account_password: string;
  agree_to_eula: boolean;
  eula: string;
}

/**
 * Logs in using the username and password entered on the login form
 */
export default async function connect(
  transaction: Transaction<Session>, connectionFormData: ConnectionFormData): Promise<void> {

  // STEP 1: Validation
  if (!connectionFormData.agree_to_eula) {
    throw new Error(`You must agree to the terms and conditions`);
  }

  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects
  let data: AuthenticateRequest = {
    operation: "authenticate",
    ...connectionFormData,
  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  const response = await apiClient.request<AuthenticateResponse>({ data });

  // STEP 4: Store session data in the transaction.session property,
  // which is persisted across all method calls
  transaction.session = {
    id: response.data.id,
    ip: response.data.ip,
    created: response.data.created,
    language: response.data.language,
  };
}
```
