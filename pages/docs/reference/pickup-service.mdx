description:
  The page describes how to define a pickup service.

documentation: |
  A Pickup Service allows the sender to request that one ore more packages
   be picked up at a specified time and location. Each pickup service that is offered must be defined
  in its own pickup service definition file. This file can reside anywhere within your application as long as its location is specified in the [Carrier Application Definition](./carrier.mdx) file.
   The definition may be specified in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), or
    [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

  These pickup service definitions will be used by the [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx) to display pickup service options within our suite of e-commerce applications when your carrier is used.
