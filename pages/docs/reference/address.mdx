Address Objects
====================

Addresses are used throughout [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx). Your application will almost certainly need to access or return address objects. Examples include the origin and destination addresses of a shipment, a carrier pickup location, a warehouse, etc.

Each address object has properties for the street, city, province, country, and postal code. Some addresses also include contact information, such as a person's name, email, and phone number.

The properties that are required when an `AddressWithContactInfo` object is expected are included below. Only include these additional properties
when an `AddressWithContactInfo` object is required. If an Address object is expected, the type for the property will be `Address`. In this case, only include the properties that are not marked as contact info properties.



Address Argument
--------------------------------------------
This table lists which properties are provided when an address object is passed to a method.
For example, the argument passed to the [createShipment method](./methods/create-shipment.mdx) in a Carrier App
uses an `AddressWithContactInfo` object for the `shipTo` and `shipFrom` properties.

The properties that are required when an `AddressWithContactInfo` object is expected are included below. Only include these additional properties
when an `AddressWithContactInfo` object is required. If an Address object is expected, the type for the property will be `Address`. In this case, only include the properties that are not marked as contact info properties.
