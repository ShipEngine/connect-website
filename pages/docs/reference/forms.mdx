  This page describes how to create a form and which fields are required.

documentation: |
  Forms are used to gather data from end users who interact with your application from within one of our e-commerce
  solutions.

  Your application must supply a form for gathering the information necessary to connect a user to your backend API or service.
  When a user selects your service from within one of our applications, your form will be presented to collect the requested
  information. The data collected from this form will then be passed
  to your [`connect`](./methods/connect.md) method via the `connectionFormData` parameter where you can use it to authenticate the user.
  You will need to provide the path to this form in the [Carrier Application definition](./carrier.md) file in the `connectionForm`
  property.

  Your application must also supply a settings form that allows an end-user to update their connection information, such
  as when the password is changed. You will need to provide the path to this form in the Carrier Application definition file in
  the `settingsForm` property.

  Both forms should be created using [React JSON Schema Forms](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form).
  The following [site](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/) can be used to test and create your own forms.
  The `dataSchema` object will go in the `JSONSchema` editor and the `uiSchema` object will go in the `UISchema` editor.



parameters:
  fields:
    - name: dataSchema
      type: "[JSONSchema](https://json-schema.org/)"

          *  referenced via an external JSON/YAML file
          *  dynamically imported via `require()` or `import()`

      type: "[uiSchema](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/uiSchema/)"
