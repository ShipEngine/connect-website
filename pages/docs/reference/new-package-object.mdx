       Some carriers provide general-purpose fields on their labels for custom text.
       This is sometimes used for messages, like "Thank you for shopping with us!",
       or may be used to store reference data, such as account numbers, warehouse codes, etc.

       The exact location on the label depends on the carrier, as does the allowed number of fields
       and the maximum length of each field. If more fields are specified than are supported by the
       carrier, then the extra fields should be ignored. Likewise, if a field length exceeds the
       carrier's maximum length, then it should be truncated. The *actual* values that are used
       should be returned, so the caller can detect any differences.

       Note that these fields should NOT be used to set **named** fields on the label,
       such as "RMA Number" or "Order ID". Those should be set using the correspond
       properties of the shipment.

       Each string in this array will be between `0` and `100` characters and will not contain newline characters.
