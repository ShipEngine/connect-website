  The Order Application Definition file tells the [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx) where to find the resources that define
  your application, such as methods and forms.


  This file can reside anywhere within your application as long as its location is specified
  in the `main` property of your `package.json` file.
  The definition may be specified in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), or
  [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
