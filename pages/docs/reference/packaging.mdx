description:
  The page describes how to define a type of packaging.

documentation: |
  Carrier packaging options are defined inside files that are then used by the [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx) to offer these
  packaging options to users who utilize the carrier within one of our e-commerce applications. Each packaging type that you wish to offer
  should have its own definition file. These files can reside anywhere within your application as long as their locations are specified in the [Carrier Application Definition](./carrier.mdx) file.
   The definition may be specified in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), or
    [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
