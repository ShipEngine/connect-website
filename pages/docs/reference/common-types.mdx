==========================
This page lists the valid values for some of the common types that are used throughout a [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx) application.

Charge Types
-----------------------------------
This is the list of values for charge types. You will use one of these values in the type property of a charges array. For example, the [rateShipment](./methods/rate-shipment.mdx) returns a rate object that includes
a charges array since the total shipping charges are a large factor in selecting a rate.

{{typesTable(charges)}}

Notes Types
------------------------------------------
This is the list of values for note types. You will use one of these values in the type property of a notes array. For example, the [createShipment](./methods/create-shipment.mdx) method receives a new shipment object that includes
a notes array. Most of the objects passed to and from your methods will contain a notes array.
