Params:
  fields:
    - name: session
      type: object
      description: |

        An object containing session information needed to make calls to your backend API or service, such as
        a username and password or an auth token.

        The data included in this object depends on your service. You will need to
        provide the information your methods need to make calls without calling your [`connect`](./../reference/methods/connect.mdx)
        method.
      default: |

         An empty `session` unless you provide a `connectArgs` property.

    - name: connectArgs
      type: object
      description: |

        An object containing properties with the same names as those your defined in
        your [connection form](./../reference/forms.mdx#connection-form-examples). These will be used to call your
        [`connect`](./../reference/methods/connect.mdx) to obtain a valid `session` object before calling other methods in the test.

      default: |

         An empty `session` unless you provide a `session` property.

    - name: expectedErrorMessage
      type: string
      description: The error message that is expected when running this test.
        </br> </br>

        This property is useful in negative test cases.
        For example, you may wish to provide invalid weights and verify that the expected error message is returned.
      default: None

    - name: deliveryServiceName
      type: string
      description: |

         The name of the [delivery service](./../reference/delivery-service.mdx) you wish to use in this request.
      default: The name of the first domestic delivery service defined for your app.

    - name: label
      type: object
      description: An object representing the details of the label to be produced by this method.
      default: |

        The properties and their default values are listed below.

        Note that these are the default values used when no `label` parameter is specified.

        If a `label` parameter is specified, it must contain values for all required properties.

    - name: label.size
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |

        The size of the label. Valid values include the following:
         * `A4`- A4 sized paper ( 8.27 inches x 11.69 inches)
         * `letter` - Letter sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches)
         * `4x6` - Paper sized 4 inches by 6 inches
         * `4x8` - Paper sized 4 inches by 8 inches
      default: |

        The first `labelSize` found for the specified [delivery service](./../reference/delivery-service.mdx).

    - name: label.format
      type: string
      required: true
      description: |

        The format for the label. Valid values include the following:
        * `pdf` - Portable Document Format (PDF)
        * `zpl` - Zebra Printer Label (ZPL)
        * `png` - Portable Graphics Format (PNG)
      default: |

        The first `labelFormat` found for the specified [delivery service](./../reference/delivery-service.mdx).

    - name: label.referenceFields
      type: string[]
      required: false
      description: |
        Some carriers provide general-purpose fields on their labels for custom text.
        This is sometimes used for messages, like "Thank you for shopping with us!",
        or may be used to store reference data, such as account numbers, warehouse codes, etc.

        The exact location on the label depends on the carrier, as does the allowed number of fields
        and the maximum length of each field. If more fields are specified than are supported by the
        carrier, then the extra fields should be ignored. Likewise, if a field length exceeds the
        carrier's maximum length, then it should be truncated. The *actual* values that are used
        should be returned, so the caller can detect any differences.

        NOTE: These fields should NOT be used to set *named* fields on the label,
        such as "RMA Number" or "Order ID". Those should be set using the correspond
        properties of the shipment.
      default: None
