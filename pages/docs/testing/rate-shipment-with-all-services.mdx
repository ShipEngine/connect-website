Params:
  fields:

    - name: session
      type: object
      description: |

        An object containing session information needed to make calls to your backend API or service, such as
        a username and password or an auth token.

        The data included in this object depends on your service. You will need to
        provide the information your methods need to make calls without calling your [`connect`](./../reference/methods/connect.mdx)
        method.
      default: |

        An empty `session` unless you provide a `connectArgs` property.

    - name: connectArgs
      type: object
      description: |

        An object containing properties with the same names as those your defined in
        your [connection form](./../reference/forms.mdx#connection-form-examples). These will be used to call your
        [`connect`](./../reference/methods/connect.mdx) to obtain a valid `session` object before calling other methods in the test.

      default: |

        An empty `session` unless you provide a `session` property.

    - name: expectedErrorMessage
      type: string
      description: The error message that is expected when running this test.
        </br> </br>

        This property is useful in negative test cases.
        For example, you may wish to provide invalid weights and verify that the expected error message is returned.
      default: None

    - name: shipFrom
      type: |

        [AddressWithContactInfo](./../reference/address.mdx)
      description: |

        The address to ship _from_ in the test. Be sure to include the additional contact info properties.
      default: |
        A valid domestic address based on the `originCountries` and `destinationCountries` of the delivery service.

        Note that this is the default value used when no `shipFrom` parameter is specified.


        If a `shipFrom` parameter is specified, it must contain values for all required properties.
      required: true


    - name: shipTo
      type: |

         If a `shipTo` parameter is specified, it must contain values for all required properties.
      required: true


    - name: weight
