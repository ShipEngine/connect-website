Transactions and Retries
==================

Every [ShipEngine Connect](./index.mdx) application method accepts a [Transaction](reference/transaction.mdx) object as parameter. It is responsible for providing contextual information about the specific method call in regards to:

* The user's authentication state.
* Saved session data.
* The specific ShipEngine Connect call via the `id` property.

Retries
-------
API failures and failed network connections are unfortunately an unavoidable part of hosting an API.

To account for this, the `Transaction` object provides the `id` property, which uniquely identifies the current transaction.

This property should be used to detect retries from ShipEngine Connect as well as used to detect and prevent duplicate operations.
