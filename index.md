App Development Process
--------------------------------

<div id="process">

  1. Use our [command-line tooling](./cli.md) to automatically generate the scaffolding for your application.

  2. [Implement your app](./create-first-app.md) using the tools you already know and love, like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

  3. [Test](./testing/index.md) your application locally using our CLI, and even debug it using your favorite JavaScript debugger, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging), [WebStorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2017/09/debugging-node-js-apps-in-webstorm/), or [Chrome DevTools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27).

  4. [Publish](./publish.md) your app to the ShipEngine Integration Platform, and you will have immediate access to an entire ecosystem of e-commerce customers.
    Meanwhile, we will take care of hosting, scaling, and providing high-availability access to your integration application.

Types of Applications
---------------------------------
The ShipEngine Integration Platform supports [carrier apps](./carrier-app/index.md) and [order apps](./order-app/index.md), with plans to offer other types of applications in the near future.

### Carrier App
If you are a company that provides shipping services, referred to as a "shipping carrier", you can build a [Carrier Application](./carrier-app/index.md) to make your shipping services available within any of the suite of e-commerce applications mentioned above. This allows your carrier to be listed as a shipping option any time an order is placed and processed.

<div id="coming-soon">

  ### Order App
  A company that provides order management, such as an online marketplace, can build an Order Application to
  allow your sellers to import, manage and fulfill their orders using any of the products in the suite of
  e-commerce applications mentioned above.
