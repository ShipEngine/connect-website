# ShipEngine Connect Website

This repo is the public website for [ShipEngine Connect](https://connect.shipengine.com/), including its documentation.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, and it uses [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) for the documentation pages.

## Development Environment Setup

### System Requirements

- [Node.js v14](https://nodejs.org/) or later
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- This project works on MacOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux

### Installation

Use yarn to install all dependencies needed for local development:

```bash
yarn
```

## Development Process

### Local Development

Start the local Next.js development server, which automatically cleans the output directory, does a full re-build, monitors the source code for changes, and does incremental re-builds whenever changes are detected.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Anytime you make code changes, you should run the tests to confirm that your code didn't break anything. Currently the `lint` script simply runs ESLint to verify that the code complies with our lint rules.

```bash
yarn lint
```

You should also periodically update dependencies using this command:

```bash
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

### QA / Review

We use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the ShipEngine Connect website. One of the nice features of Vercel is that it creates a preview URL for every Git branch and PR, so you can see how the site will look in production and share the link with others to review .

Just push your changes to your branch/PR and then go to [the Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/shipengine) to monitor the build process and get your preview URL.

### Releasing to Prod

Once you've reviewed your changes on the preview website and are happy with them, releasing to production is just a matter of merging to `master` and pushing. Vercel will automatically deploy the site to [connect.shipengine.com](https://connect.shipengine.com).
