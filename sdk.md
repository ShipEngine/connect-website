Integration Platform SDK
========================
The [ShipEngine Integration Platform SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipengine/integration-platform-sdk) has everything you need to quickly and efficiently build an integration application.
As a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-based project, it contains all of the type definitions for every resource that will be required for your project.

When combined with a source code editor that provides intellisense and auto-completion, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), our SDK accelerates your development efforts by providing a richer
environment for spotting common errors _as you type the code_.
