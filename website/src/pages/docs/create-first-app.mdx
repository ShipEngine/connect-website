Creating Your First App
=======================
[ShipEngine Connect CLI](./cli.mdx) provides you with everything you need to get started with your integration application.


> **INFO:** Install [ShipEngine Connect CLI](./cli.mdx) before proceeding with this guide.

Using the CLI
------------------

1. To create a new project, open a terminal on your computer and navigate to the directory where you would like to add your new project
by running the following command: `cd my-project-directory`

1. Run the following command: [`connect init`](./cli.mdx#initialize-a-new-app)

1. Enter the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package name you would like to give your application. The default value is the name of the directory in which you ran the command. Type a new value for the name or press `Enter` to accept the default name.

1. Enter the npm package scope you would like to give your application. In most cases, you should use your company name (e.g. `@your-company-name`)

1. Use the arrow keys to select whether you want to create a [Carrier App](./carrier-app/index.mdx) or [Order App](./order-app/index.mdx), then press `Enter`.

1. Enter a description for your application, and press `Enter`.

1. Enter a value to be used in the author property of your `package.json` file. If you are logged into GitHub in the terminal from which you ran the command, your GitHub user information
will be populated as the default. Type a new author value, or press `Enter` to accept the default.

1. Enter a value to be used in the version property of your `package.json` file. This value defaults to `1.0.0`. Press `Enter` to accept the default value, and then update this property in your `package.json` file anytime you publish your
application.

1. Use the arrow keys to select either `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` as your language and press `Enter`.

1. Use the arrow keys to select `YAML`, `JSON`, `JavaScript`, or `TypeScript` for your [definition files](./structure.mdx#application-definition). Note that you can use a combination of
these options when you populate your definition files. This command will create them in the specified format, but you can change them before publishing your application.

1. Type `Y` or `N` to indicate whether or not you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your development environment and press `Enter`. When you use VS Code, ShipEngine Connect CLI provides you with a
debug command in the scripts section of your `package.json` file and generates a `.vscode/launch.json` file to faciliate [debugging](./testing/index.mdx#visual-studio-code).

Your Application
--------------------------
All done! You now have the application structure laid out, and you are ready to provide the implementation.

### Methods

In the `src/methods` directory, you will find a file for each [method](./structure.mdx#methods) that can be implemented by the application type you selected. Each file
contains a stubbed out method in the language you specified when you ran the command. It contains comments to remind you of the steps
required to [implement each method](./implementation.mdx). You aren't required to maintain this directory structure. You
can choose to implement all your methods in one file or choose a different directory structure. As long as your [application definition](./structure.mdx#application-definition)
specifies the path to a file that exports the method, the structure is up to you. This is an example of the method stub that is generated for the `createShipment` method of a [Carrier Application](./carrier-app/index.mdx).

<CodeWrapper>
```javascript
"use strict";

/**
 * Generates a shipping label and tracking number for a shipment
 *
 * View documentation here:
 * https://connect.shipengine.com/docs/reference/methods/create-shipment
 *
 * View sample implementation here:
 * https://github.com/ShipEngine/connect-samples/blob/master/freightco/carrier/create-shipment.js
 */
async function createShipment(transaction, shipment) {
  throw new Error("NotImplementedError");
  // STEP 1: Validation
  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects
  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
}

module.exports = createShipment;

```

```typescript
import { NewShipment, ShipmentConfirmation, Transaction } from "@shipengine/connect";
import { Session } from "./session";

/**
 * Generates a shipping label and tracking number for a shipment
 *
 * See an example implementation below
 * https://github.com/ShipEngine/connect-samples/blob/master/parcel-post/carrier/src/methods/create-shipment.ts
 */
export default async function createShipment(
  transaction: Transaction<Session>,
  shipment: NewShipment,
): Promise<ShipmentConfirmation> {
  throw new Error("NotImplementedError");
  // STEP 1: Validation
  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects
  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
}
```
</CodeWrapper>

### Definitions
In the `src/definitions` directory, you will find a sample file with the required properties for each type of [definition](./structure.mdx#definitions) you can provide for your application. For example,
in a Carrier Application, you may provide one or more definitions for the following: [delivery service](./reference/delivery-service.mdx), [delivery confirmation](./reference/delivery-confirmation.mdx),
and [packaging](./reference/packaging.mdx).

As with methods, you aren't required to maintain this directory structure. As long as your [application definition](./structure.mdx#application-definition) specifies the correct paths to the definitions you want to include, you can organize your files however you'd like.
In addition to the definitions for the services that are offered, running this command creates a sample application definition as well. It uses the values you provided when you ran the command along with some default values. This definition resides in an `index` file in the
`src` directory. You can change the location of this file as long as you provide the correct path to it in your `package.json` file.

> **WARNING**
> Once you have [published](./cli.mdx#publish-your-app) your app, you must not change the `id`, `name`, or `code` properties for any of your
> definitions.

This is an example of the application definition that is generated for a Carrier Application.

### Implement
Once you have generated the scaffolding for your application using ShipEngine Connect CLI, add your implementation for each method your application supports. Likewise, use the example service definition files to create unique definitions
for each of the services your application provides. Finally, update the application definition to include all the methods and definitions you have implemented.

### Test
As you're building your app, you'll want to run it periodically so you can test and debug your code. Luckily, [ShipEngine Connect CLI](cli.mdx) includes commands to help with this,
such as `connect start` and [`connect test`](./testing/index.mdx#acceptance-testing). You can also write your own unit tests to exercise your code. See our [testing page](testing/index.mdx) for more information.

### Publish
Once all the generated tests pass, you will publish your application to ShipEngine Connect using the [`connect publish`](./publish.mdx) command. This command will publish to a development environment where your application
will be reviewed and further end-to-end testing may be performed before your application is published to production and made available within our suite of e-commerce solutions.

> **NOTE:** ShipEngine Connect currently runs Node.js v12
