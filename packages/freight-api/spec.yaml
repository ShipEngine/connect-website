      summary: Provision Freight Provider Account
      description: |-
        Provision a freight provider account for a tenant. Freight carrier integrations might be direct to the carrier or via a provider such as SMC3. When a freight carrier requires it, a freight provider account must be created for each tenant making requests to the Freight API. The registry will indicate what type of freight provider account is required, so if a tenant does not have an account of the type required then it is the responsibility of the caller to provision one on behalf of the tenant for the correct type and persist the resulting access token. Once the caller has an access token of the correct type it can be reused for any calls for that tenant for all freight carriers that require a freight provider account of that type, sent in the `auth` section of subsequent requests.

        Freight provider accounts typically identify a tenant within an external system, linking any carrier credentials to that tenant, so the recommendation is that the definition of a tenant in this situation is an individual user vs a service-level identity or similar. In the case of SMC3 only one set of credentials per carrier is active per freight provider account, so attempting to add multiple accounts for a single carrier will result in the requests simply overwriting each other.

        The actual request to create a freight provider account must include the freight provider's API code as defined in the registry as the value of the header `FreightApiCode`.

        Note: at this point in time freight provider account access tokens do not expire but that may be a consideration to keep in mind for future freight providers that we integrate with.

If a confirmation number is not returned but the request succeeded the user will need to follow up with the carrier directly to ensure that they received the request. If a PRO number is not returned then one will be assigned by the carrier at the time of pickup. Additionally some carriers might not support specifying a delivery date for pickup requests. If that is the case the user will again need to coordinate that directly with the carrier. When SMC3 is the freight provider both of these situations will result in a message being included in the response that you can display to the user.

        Obtain a spot price quote for a freight shipment. Spot quotes are typically discounted rates based on excess carrier capacity vs contractual rates. The carrier will return the service level they are able to offer as opposed to specifying the desired service level in the request.

        Note: in terms of user workflow for spot quotes, the expectation is that the quote ID coming back from the carrier is included on the BOL they provide the carrier at the time of pickup, allowing the carrier to match the shipment to the original quote and invoice it correctly. Additionally, as spot quotes can expire, if the quote has expired at the time of pickup a new spot quote should be created to include in the BOL.
