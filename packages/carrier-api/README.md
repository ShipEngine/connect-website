# TypeScript Library

The purpose of this library is to fill a similar role that CarrierApi.Common serves for C# but for JavaScript & TypeScript. It will contain the models and definitions for Request/Response Bodies.

## Building & Publishing

To build the project use this command in the terminal from this directory.

```
npm run-script build
```

this will generate a `./lib` directory which contains the JavaScript & TypeScript.

To publish make sure you set the appropriate version in the package.json file
**change directory to the ./lib directory and publish**

```
npm publish
```

**DO NOT PUBLISH FROM THIS DIRECTORY**
_this is because the pathing for the package will be weird, exposing both the src directory and the lib directory we want imports to be able to look like this_

```javascript
import CreateLabelRequest from '@ipaas/capi/requests';
```

_and not like this_

```javascript
import CreateLabelRequest from '@ipaas/capi/lib/requests';
```
