 * Blob of credentials used to authorize requests to 3rd-party inventory providers.

 * of this shape.
 *
 * The precise shape of the blob will vary among 3rd-party inventory providers,
 * but these will reliably be key-value pairs where the keys are strings and the
 * values are primitives â€“ aka no nested properties.
