Shipping Options
===============================================
A shipping options object contains the shipping options that are specific to your carrier only. 


> **NOTE:** 
> Currently we only support a small subset for our DHL integration. A generic approach that is applicable to 
> all carriers will be implemented in the future.

Properties
-----------------------------------------------

This table lists the properties of a `shippingOptions` object and identifies those properties that are required. The `nullable`
column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods, and the `required`
column indicates which properties are required when the object is returned from one of your methods.
