Local Dev API
==================================================
[The `connect start` command](./../cli.mdx#run-your-app-locally) starts a local web server that exposes your app as a REST API
and allows you to invoke your app's
methods using [our Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12340335/T1LPBRJk?version=latest). The server
monitors your source code and automatically reloads your app whenever changes are detected, so if you find a bug, you can
fix it and immediately retry.

Click the <b>Run in Postman</b> button to open our collection directly in Postman: &nbsp;&nbsp;
<PostmanButton />

You can run the `connect start command` from the command line or directly from within [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the
`launch.json` config file that was generated when you ran `connect init`. Additionally, you can run `npm start` just like
you would to start any other NodeJS application.

> **PRO TIP:** You can use the [VSCode debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) to set breakpoints, step through your code line-by-line, and inspect variables at runtime. Just press `F5` to start a debug session.

Request Modification
-------------------------------------
Each request in [our Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12340335/T1LPBRJk?version=latest) contains sample data that matches the structure expected by one of the methods in your application. We have included placeholder text
in the areas where you will need to provide values.

For example, when running the `Create a shipment` request in the `Carrier Apps` folder, you will need to provide IDs for
`shipment.delivery_service.id` and `shipment.packages[].packaging.id` that are defined in your application.

You may also need to modify the `shipFrom` and `shipTo` properties
to addresses within your service area and ensure that the `shipDateTime` is in the future.

Note that you will likely need to update the properties in the `Connect` request to match the names you used in your [connection form](./../reference/forms.mdx#connection-form-examples).

You can begin running requests in this collection as soon as you have defined the corresponding method, even if it is not fully implemented.
It may be useful to set a breakpoint and examine the structure of the data sent to your method to assist in mapping the input
data to the format expected by your backend service or API.

Authentication
----------------------------------------

You may have noticed that each request in our Postman collection contains a `transaction` object that contains a `session` property.
Once you are ready for your method to call your backend API or service, you will need to specify authentication information.

### Postman Variables
Our Postman collection uses variables to persist session data between requests. You can see in the request below that we set the `transaction.session`
property to `{{session}}`. This is the way Postman variables are referenced within request payloads. While it is not valid
JSON at the moment, it will be once Postman renders the request.

You can see and set the value of the variables by editing the collection. Click the ellipses icon next to the collection name
and select `Edit`, then click the `Variables` tab.

When you first import the collection, the `session`
variable will be unset.

When beginning to work with our Postman collection, you should first run the `Connect` request in the `All Apps` folder with valid credentials to create a session. This will then set the `session` variable that is referenced in each of the other requests. Likewise, if you already
have a valid session you wish to use, you can edit the variable directly and skip running the `Connect` request.

### Hardcoded Values
You may wish to hardcode the session data in each of your requests rather than using Postman variables. If so, you will need to run the `Connect`
request with valid credentials and then copy the `transaction.session` value that is returned and update each Postman request to use this value.
Likewise, if you already have a valid session you wish to use, you can skip running the `Connect` request and add the
`session` data directly to the request.
