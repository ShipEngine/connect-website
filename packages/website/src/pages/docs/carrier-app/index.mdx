Carrier Application Overview
=================================

The [Carrier](../reference/carrier.mdx) application is intended to be implemented by companies that provide shipping services (aka carriers).
It consists of specifying the various [delivery](../reference/delivery-service.mdx) and [pickup](../reference/pickup-service.mdx) services that
your carrier offers and implementing the methods that correspond to the available services.
