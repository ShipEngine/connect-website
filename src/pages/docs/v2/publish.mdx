Publishing Your Application
===========================

One of the key benefits of integrating your service with [ShipEngine Connect](../../index.mdx) is that we will take care of hosting your application, ensuring that it scales to meet the
needs of end users, and making it highly available at all times.

Part of your application's development cycle will involve end-to-end testing. To facilitate this, you can publish your application to our development environment for further testing before submitting it for production review.

> **NOTE:** ShipEngine Connect currently runs Node.js v12


Before you Publish
------------------

### Publishing a Carrier App
Before you can publish your Carrier application to ShipEngine Connect, you must define at least one of each of the following:
- Connection form
- Settings form
- Delivery service
- Packaging
- Delivery confirmation

This gives ShipEngine Connect the minimum amount of information it needs to present your app as a service provider inside one of our e-commerce applications,
where you may further test and interact with your application.

### Tests
Before publishing, you should verify that the [tests run by ShipEngine Connect CLI](testing/index.mdx#automated-testing) are all passing. This will tell you if you have any structural
issues with your application, such as missing the minimum implementation required for publishing. It also runs an extensive set
of functional tests that help validate your application further.

### Application Name
Your application's identity in ShipEngine Connect will be determined by the scoped `name` property in your project's `package.json`
<br></br>(ie `@org/app-name`) along with the `id` specified in your application definition file.

The scoped package name as well as the `id` will be used to uniquely identify your application within ShipEngine Connect. 

For this reason, it is important that you not change either of these values once you have published your app.

> **WARNING:** Once you have published your app, you must not change the `id` or `name` of the app.


### Definition Immutability

[Definition](structure.mdx#Definitions) `id`, `name`,  and `code` properties are used internally to uniquely identify your application's resources.

Each `id`, `name`, and `code` property should contain a unique value. The properties should never be changed once the application is published to ShipEngine Connect.

Only one delivery confirmation definition file should be created for each unique delivery confirmation `type` as this value may be used internally to lookup the specified delivery confirmation
when no other identifiers are present.

> **WARNING:** Once you have published your app, you must not change the `id`, `name` or `code` for any of your definitions.


### API Key
Before you publish your application, you will need to contact the [ShipEngine Connect Team](mailto:connect@shipengine.com) to have an API Key provisioned for you.


Publish
-------
From the root of your project run the [`connect publish` command](./cli.mdx#publish-your-app).

Once all the tests executed by the CLI are passing, your application will be packaged and published to our development environment.

By default, the CLI will watch your app while it is being published to give you an update on where it is in the publishing process. If you
do not wish to watch your app, simply use the `--no-watch` option when you run the command.

Once you have completed your end-to-end testing, you can submit your application for production review. 

After it has been reviewed, it will be promoted to our production environment where end users can begin to use your services.
