Getting Started
================

In order to add your service to ShipEngine Connect and make it available within our suite of e-commerce applications,
you'll need to create a JavaScript application.

Our documentation assumes that you understand:
* Basic programming concepts
* How to use a terminal on your computer
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (_optional - you can use plain JavaScript_)

After upgrading your @shipengine/connect to at least **2.0.0** using the `npm install -g @shipengine/connect`, run the init command `connect init`.
This will walk you through the initialization process and will generate the brand new template.

These new application types contain both the runtime & the domain specific library needed for your app to run (Order Source/Carrier).
The hope is that you will have a normal JavaScript/TypeScript development lifecycle while working on these projects
using familiar commands like `npm start`, `npm run-script build`, `npm test` to work on your project locally.

ShipEngine Connect Apps
------------------------
ShipEngine Connect apps are NPM packages that export an object matching a certain structure. Please see our app definitions and sample apps for more information.

* [Carrier app definition](./app-definition/carrier.mdx)
* [Carrier app samples](https://github.com/ShipEngine/connect/tree/master/samples/carrier)
* [Order source app definition](./app-definition/order-source.mdx)
* [Order source app samples](https://github.com/ShipEngine/connect/tree/master/samples/order-source)

Your app will run in our hosted Node.js runtime environment. We take care of hosting, scaling, and providing high-availability access to your application 
so you can just focus on the core functionality.

Developer Tooling
------------------------------------------
The [ShipEngine Connect NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipengine/connect) provides TypeScript type definitions, enumerations,
and helper classes for you to use in your app. It also provides a [command-line interface](./cli.mdx) to aid you in your application development.

Use it to:
* [Scaffold a new application](create-first-app.mdx#create-new-project)
* [Test your application](testing/index.mdx)
* [Publish your application](publish.mdx)

API Documentation
------------------------------------------
[Carrier API Reference](https://shipstation.github.io/integrations-shipping/carrierapi-redoc.html)

Using the `npm start` command will bring up a locally running server (port 3005 by default), going to `localhost:3005/docs` will bring up the documentation associated with your application type.

App Definition Documentation
------------------------------------------
The metadata associated with an app is used to drive behavior in our products and is what our customers see.
You can learn more about the metadata associated with your app type at the following links.
* [Carrier](./app-definition/carrier.mdx)
* [Order Source](./app-definition/order-source.mdx)

Testing
------------------------------------------
There are a few ways to test your application.
 * Install a testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), etc and write local unit tests
 * Run `npm start` and hit your module locally using something like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
 * Run the `connect publish` command and test your application in the ShipEngine Connect ShipStation Development Environment

A helpful tip is to publish your application to the development environment to test out the expected functionality and then do a `connect logs` to get request response logs from your module,
and then use those requests to create unit tests or postman requests for local trouble shooting.
