# Managing Environment Variables

One of the key benefits of integrating your service with [ShipEngine Connect](../../index.mdx) is that we will handle
hosting your application for you. In order for us to do that, ShipEngine Connect may need access to sensitive data,
such as the credentials used to connect to your backend service.

You may securely provide such information using the [`connect env` command](./cli#manage-environment-variables).
This command allows you to define environment variables at the time your application is published that will be injected
into your application when it is running in ShipEngine Connect.

In addition to storing application secrets, environment variables are useful for storing your configuration data, such
as the URL for your backend API, so that you can easily switch between environments without making any changes to your
application. This is one of the tenets of [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/), which we highly recommend
considering when planning your application.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> Your app will use the environment variable values set at the time it is published. If you makes changes to those
> variables, you will need to re-publish your app before they take effect in ShipEngine Connect.

## Using the CLI

The [ShipEngine Connect CLI](./cli.mdx#manage-environment-variables) provides an `env` command with several subcommands that help you manage the
environment variables available within your application.

> **PRO TIP:**
> You can leave off the `env` part of the command and just specify the subcommand. For example, you can run
> `connect list` to list the environment variables rather than `connect env:list`.

### Setting Environment Variables

The `connect env:set` subcommand is used to set one or more environment variables.

#### Example

This example shows running the `connect env:set` command and its output.

```bash
$ connect env:set MY_VARIABLE=foo my_second_variable=bar
MY_VARIABLE=foo has been set.
MY_SECOND_VARIABLE=bar has been set.
```

> **NOTE:** Environment variable names will always be uppercased.

### Getting Specific Environment Variables

The `connect env:get` subcommand is used get the value of one or more environment variables. This is useful when you
have a lot of environment variables to be able to get the value of the variable(s) of interest.

#### Example

This example shows running the `connect env:get` command for the `MY_VARIABLE` environment variable.

```bash
$ connect env:get my_second_variable
┌─────────────┬───────┐
│ Name        │ Value │
├─────────────┼───────┤
│ MY_VARIABLE │ foo   │
└─────────────┴───────┘
```

### Removing an Unwanted Environment Variable

The `connect env:unset` command is used to unset one or more environment variables. After running this command,
the specified environment variable will no longer be set the next time you publish your app.

#### Example

This example shows running the `connect env:unset` command and its output.

```bash
$ connect env:unset my_second_variable
MY_VARIABLE has been removed as an environment variable.
```

### Listing Environment Variables

The `connect env:list` command is used to list all the environment variables that are set along with their values.

#### Example

This example shows running the `connect env:list` command and its default output.

```bash
$ connect env:list
┌────────────────────┬─────────┐
│ Name               │ Value   │
├────────────────────┼─────────┤
│ MY_SECOND_VARIABLE │ bar     │
├────────────────────┼─────────┤
│ MY_VARIABLE        │ foo     │
└────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

You can use the `--format` option to list environment variables in table format or in a format
for easy use with [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

#### Example

This example shows running the `connect env:list` command using the `--format` option (`-f` for short), specifying the `dotenv` format.

```
$ connect env:list -f dotenv
MY_SECOND_VARIABLE=bar
MY_VARIABLE=foo
```

### Accessing Environment Variable

It is easy to access environment variables from within your Node.js application by using the [`process.env` property](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env)
that is available out-of-the-box with Node.js.

#### Example

This examples shows how to access an environment variable from within your ShipEngine Connect application.

```javascript
console.log(`MY_VARIABLE is: ${process.env.MY_VARIABLE}`)
```
