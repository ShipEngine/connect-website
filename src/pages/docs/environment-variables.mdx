Managing Environment Variables for Your Application
===========================

One of the key benefits of integrating your service with [ShipEngine Connect](./index.mdx) is that we will take care of
hosting your application and setting environment variables that you define.

It is typical for a twelve-factor app to supply [configuration](https://12factor.net/config) via Environment Variables.
As such [ShipEngine Connect](./index.mdx) allows you to specify configuration and secrets for your application, assuring
that secrets are stored in an encrypted enclave.

> **INFO:** Environment Variables are set for an Application during the [publish](./publish.mdx) process.

Using the CLI to Manage Environment Variables
------------------

### Accessing Environment Variable

Accessing an environment variable in Node is supported by default. Upon staring up Node will load environment variables
for the process and make them available in `process.env`.
For details on Node Process see the [documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/process.html#process_process_env).

```bash
$ cat test.js
console.log(`MY_VARIABLE is: ${process.env.MY_VARIABLE}`);
$ MY_VARIABLE=foo node test.js
MY_VARIABLE is: foo
```

#### Environment Variables and Application Publishing

When an application is [published](./publish.mdx) the environment variables that have been set *at that time* are
injected into the application's runtime environment. In other words, updating environment variable after a successful
publish will not change those variables for that publish, you must re-publish.

### Setting Environment Variables

Setting one or more environment variables can be done with the `env` topic in the ShipEngine Connect CLI.

```bash
$ connect env:set MY_VARIABLE=foo my_second_variable=bar
MY_VARIABLE=foo has been set.
MY_SECOND_VARIABLE=bar has been set.
```

> **NOTE:** Environment Variable Names will always be UPCASED

### Listing Environment Variables

List environment variables that have been set for the application with `env:list`

```bash
$ connect env:list
┌────────────────────┬─────────┐
│ Name               │ Value   │
├────────────────────┼─────────┤
│ MY_SECOND_VARIABLE │ bar     │
├────────────────────┼─────────┤
│ MY_VARIABLE        │ foo     │
└────────────────────┴─────────┘
```

You can also list environment variables in dotenv format for easy use with dotenv.

```
$ connect env:list -f dotenv
MY_SECOND_VARIABLE=bar
MY_VARIABLE=foo
```

### Getting Specific Environment Variables

If you have a large number of environment variables you can get specific variables by name.

```bash
$ connect env:get my_second_variable
┌─────────────┬───────┐
│ Name        │ Value │
├─────────────┼───────┤
│ MY_VARIABLE │ foo   │
└─────────────┴───────┘
```

### Removing an Unwanted Environment Variable

To remove an environment variable from your application and its next publish, use `env:unset`.

```bash
$ connect env:unset my_second_variable
MY_VARIABLE has been removed as an environment variable.
```
