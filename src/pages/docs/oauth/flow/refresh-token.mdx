# Refresh Token

Some, but not all, 3rd parties return short-lived Access Tokens that must be
refreshed using a "refresh token". The `refresh_token` component describes the
server-server interaction Auth Bridge can make to refresh an access token using a
refresh token.

The `refresh_token` flow differs from the other components of the auth flow in
that it does not require any interaction in the user's browser. The Auth Bridge
client (Application) makes a server-to-server request to the *internal* endpoint
`/internal/api/<integration-api-code>/<app-id>/refresh_token`.
The `refresh_token` flow differs from the other components of the auth flow in
that it does not require any interaction in the user's browser. The ShipEngine Connect Platform will handle any token refreshing that is required.
See the [OAuth 2.0 RFC - Refresh Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)
for details on refresh tokens.
