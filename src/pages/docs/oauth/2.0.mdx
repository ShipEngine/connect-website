# OAuth 2.0 Configuration
## OAuth 2
An Integration Definition consists of three main components, which match the
OAuth2.0 code-exchange flow. In order, they are:

1. [Authorization](./flow/authorization.mdx)
1. [Request Token](./flow/request-token.mdx)
1. [Refresh Token](./flow/refresh-token.mdx)

> **PRO TIP:** If you are not familiar with OAuth2 code-exchange flow there are many
sites online that provide information:
- [Auth0 Authorization Code Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow)
- [Okta: Authorization](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/authorization/)
- [Okta: What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

## Advanced Topics
- [Response Transformation](./advanced/response-transformation.mdx) *(specify how responses from the two exchanges can be mapped into the the platform canonical model)*
- [Connection Context](./advanced/connection-context.mdx) *(allows a response transformer to specify a collection of properties in connection_context)*

## Templating

The Integration Definition DSL JSON is processed with a simple templating engine
that supports variable substitution and some basic operations.


```json
{
    "name": "client_id",
    "value": "{installation:client_id}"
}
...
{
    "name": "refresh_token",
    "value": "{result_token_response:refresh_token}"
},
...
{
    "name": "redirect_uri",
    "value": "{system:authorize_callback_url}"
},
```

### Value Resolvers

The example above shows these templating expressions:
`{installation:}`, `{result_token_response:}` and `{system:}`. A template expression
is defined by a value enclosed in curly brackets `{}`. The value always
contains at least one colon `:`. The part before the colon identifies the Value Resolver.
The part after the colon is a parameter passed to the Value Resolver.

A value resolver is a component in the templating engine that can look up or 
compute data. The simplest value resolvers in the platform simply use the RHS to point to a property.

| Expression  | Resolver |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `{auth_state:` | [Auth State](./resolver/auth-state.mdx) |
| `{base64:` | [Base64](./resolver/base64.mdx) |
| `{callback:` | [Callback](./resolver/callback.mdx) |
| `{integration:` | [Integration](./resolver/integration.mdx) |
| `{installation:` | [Installation](./resolver/installation.mdx) |
| `{result_token_response:` | [Result Token Response](./resolver/result-token-response.mdx) |
| `{system:` | [System](./resolver/system.mdx) |
