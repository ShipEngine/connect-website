Metadata Object
===============================================
A metadata object used to contain unique user information persistant across multiple request/reponses.
Mainly used for authentication information, but could used for any information needed across mulitple requests.
Example properties would be `username`, `password`, `api_key`, or `client_id`. 

Every request to ShipEngine Connect App will contain this object if previous metadata values have been returned, and any response from an app that contains this object will be used to write data into new keys or overwrite data in old keys.

For example, say a carrier needs a basic auth token for requests, the ShipEngine Connect App could respond to the [register method](./methods/register.mdx) with the following:

```json


{
  "credentials": {
    "username": "test",
    "password": "pass"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "auth_token": "dGVzdDpwYXNz"
  }
}
```

Now a future requests including this [create label request](./methods/create-label.mdx) will contain the following:

```json


{
  "metadata": {
    "auth_token": "dGVzdDpwYXNz"
  }
  "service_code": "GND",
  // ... Rest of create label request omitted for brevity.
}
```
