Date/Time Object
===============================================
Date/time objects are used throughout [ShipEngine Connect](../index.mdx). Your app will almost certainly need to
access or return date/time objects, such as the date and time a shipment was shipped or the time and the date and time of a particular shipment tracking event.

Each date/time object has properties for the date/time string as well as a timezone string that holds either the UTC offset (e.g. "+05:30")
 or [IANA time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (e.g. "America/Los_Angeles", "Asia/Tokyo").



Properties
-----------------------------------------------
This table lists the properties of a date/time object and identifies those properties that are required. The `nullable`
column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods, and the `required`
column indicates which properties are required when the object is returned from one of your methods.


<Reference>

  <Field name="value" type="string" required={true} nullable={false}>
    <Description>
      The date and time, without a time zone (e.g. "2005-09-23T17:30:00").
    </Description>
  </Field>

  <Field name="timeZone" type="string" required={true} >
    <Description>
      The time zone represented as either the UTC offset (e.g. "+05:30") or [IANA time zone](https\:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (e.g. "America/Los_Angeles", "Asia/Tokyo").
    </Description>
  </Field>

### Examples

Here's an example datetime object that uses the UTC offset for the `timezone`:

```javascript
{
  value: "2020-09-24T17:30:00",
  timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
}
```

And here's an example that uses the IANA time zone for the timezone.

```javascript
{
  value: "2020-09-24T17:30:00",
  timezone: "+05:30"
}
```


Additional Convenience Properties
-------------------------------------------------------------
This table lists some additional convenience properties and methods that are included when a date/time object is
passed to one of your methods. None of these will ever be `null`.
