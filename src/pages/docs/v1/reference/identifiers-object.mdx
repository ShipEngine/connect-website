Identifiers Object
===============================================
Most resources in your application support an `identifiers` property. This property is useful for storing
any custom data that may be needed by your application.

For example, let's say that your backend API requires
the `shipTo` address when scheduling a pickup for a shipment. You can see that the `shipTo` address is not
included in the arguments passed to your [`schedulePickup` method]("./methods/schedulePickup") since most carriers
will obtain that information from the generated label. It could be useful to store that
information in the `identifiers` object for the `shipment`. Then when the `shipment` is sent to your `schedulePickup` method,
you will have access to the `shipTo` details via the `identifiers` property.

Your application definition files, such as the definition for a [`delivery service`](./delivery-service.mdx) or [`delivery confirmation`](./delivery-confirmation.mdx)
 also include the `identifiers` property. You can use this to store additional information about the service that may be needed later
by your app when a `delivery service` is passed as an argument to one of your methods.

The `identifiers` object stores an array of key-value pair strings. Each string must be between `0` and `100` characters
and must not contain newline characters or leading or trailing spaces.

Examples
============================

### Adding to an object returned from a method

This method uses the `identifiers` object to store data on a shipment that will be needed by another method when it receives
the shipment as an argument.


```javascript

const mapCreateShipmentResponse = (response) => {

  const {
      shipTo,
      consignmentNumber,
      label,
      rate
  } = response;

  return {
      trackingNumber: consignmentNumber,
      label: {
        type: 'label',
        size: '4x6',
        format: 'pdf',
        data: Buffer.from(label, 'base64'),
        referenceFields: []
      },
      charges: rate.charges,
      identifiers: {
        shipToName: (shipTo.name.given + ' ' + shipTo.name.family).trim(),
        shipToAddressLine1: shipTo.addressLines[0],
        shipToAddressLine2: shipTo.addressLines[1] ? shipTo.addressLines[1] : '',
        shipToAddressLine3: shipTo.addressLines[2] ? shipTo.addressLines[2] : '',
        shipToCityLocality: shipTo.cityLocality,
        shipToStateProvince: shipTo.stateProvince,
        shipToPostalCode: shipTo.postalCode,
        shipToCountry: shipTo.country,
        shipToCompany: shipTo.company
      }
    };
});

```

### Using the identifiers within a method

This example uses the `identifiers` that were set by the [`createShipment` method](./methods/createShipment)
to access internal data needed by the [`cancelShipments` method](./methods/cancel-shipments).

```javascript
module.exports = async function cancelShipments(transaction, shipmentCancellations) {

 // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects
  let data = {
    operation: "void_labels",
    session_id: transaction.session.id,
    cancellations: shipmentCancellations.map((cancellation) => {
      const { cancellationID, trackingNumber } = cancellation;
      return {
        cancellationID: cancellationID,
        internalReferenceID: cancellation.identifiers.internalReferenceID,
        trackingNumber: trackingNumber,
      };
    }),
  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
  return await formatCancellationResponse(response.data);
}
```

### Using the identifiers in a Delivery Confirmation Definition

This example specifies an internal code for the delivery confirmation using the `identifiers` object. This property
will be available whenever this delivery confirmation is passed as an argument to one of your methods.

```javascript
{
  "id": "67ba25f0-6492-417f-be47-26f7763d7853",
  "name": "Authority To Leave",
  "identifiers": {
    "internalCode": "ATL"
  },
  "description": "The carrier has the authority to leave the package at a PPOP.",
  "type": "signature"
}

```
