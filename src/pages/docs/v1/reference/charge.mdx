# Charge Object

A charge object describes an itemized charge or credit for a shipment or sales order. For example, when getting rates
for a shipment, the charge object is used to itemize the costs associated with each rate.

## Properties

This table lists the properties of a charge object and identifies those properties that are required. The `nullable`
column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods, and the `required`
column indicates which properties are required when the object is returned from one of your methods.
