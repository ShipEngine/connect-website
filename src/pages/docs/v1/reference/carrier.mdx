Carrier Application Definition
===============================================
The Carrier Application Definition file pulls all the other definitions and implementations together to tell the [ShipEngine Connect](../index.mdx) how your
carrier application is structured. This file can reside anywhere within your application as long as its location is specified
in the `main` property of your `package.json` file.
The definition may be specified in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), or
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).


> **WARNING:** Once you have published your app, you must not change the `id` or `name` of the app.
