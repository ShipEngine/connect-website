# Common Types

This page lists the valid values for some of the common types that are used throughout a [ShipEngine Connect](../index.mdx) application.

## Charge Types

This is the list of values for charge types. You will use one of these values in the type property of a charges array. For example, the [rateShipment](./methods/rate-shipment.mdx) returns a rate object that includes
a charges array since the total shipping charges are a large factor in selecting a rate.
