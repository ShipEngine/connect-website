Implementing Your Methods
======================

The purpose of developing a [ShipEngine Connect](./index.mdx) application is to provide a communication layer between your backend API or service and our
suite of e-commerce solutions where end users can utilize your services. You will provide the integration with your backend API or service when you implement the
methods generated by the [`connect init`command](./cli.mdx#initialize-a-new-app).

Every ShipEngine Connect application provides methods that correspond to the services offered through the API or service with which you are integrating.
During the course of your application development, you will likely need to map data from your
data model to match what ShipEngine Connect expects. Your method will receive data from ShipEngine Connect that it will then need to transform into
the required format before passing it along to the backend service or API. Likewise, your backend API or service will return data that will then need to be transformed
into the format expected by ShipEngine Connect before returning it from the method.

Each method will generally have the following structure and flow:

1. Validate the incoming information from ShipEngine Connect.
2. Map the data passed to your method by ShipEngine Connect to the data structure needed by the backend API or service for which your application provides the integration.
3. Call the the backend API or service for which your application provides the integration.
4. Map the response from your backend API or service to the data structure expected by ShipEngine Connect and return it from the method.

Example
--------

Let's look at an example implementation of the [createShipment method](./reference/methods/create-shipment.mdx).

The following block of code shows the method taking a `shipment` argument, which is a [NewShipment](./reference/methods/create-shipment.mdx#parameters) object, and does the following:
1. Transforms the data passed to the method by ShipEngine Connect into the structure expected by the backend API. For example, the backend API we are calling expects a property called `confirmation_code`.
We extract this value from the `package.deliveryConfirmation.code` property of the `shipment` object that was passed to this method from ShipEngine Connect.
2. Calls the backend API or service. In this example, we are calling a REST API for a carrier service and passing the `data` object we created in step 1.
3. Takes the response from the backend API and calls the `formatShipment` method to transform the carrier's label creation response into the format that ShipEngine Connect expects. For example, ShipEngine Connect requires
the return object to contain a property called `trackingNumber` which we extract from the `tracking_number` property of the `response` object returned from the backend API call performed in step 2.

<CodeWrapper>
```typescript
import { NewShipment, ShipmentConfirmation, Transaction } from "@shipengine/connect";

/**
 * Generates a shipping label and tracking number for a shipment
 */
export default async function createShipment(
  transaction: Transaction<Session>, shipment: NewShipment): Promise<ShipmentConfirmation> {

  // STEP 1: Create the data that the carrier's API expects
  let data: GenerateLabelRequest = {
    operation: "generate_label",
    session_id: transaction.session.id,
    service_code: shipment.deliveryService.code,
    confirmation_code: shipment.deliveryConfirmation.code,
    ship_date: shipment.shipDateTime.toISOString(),
    from_zone: parseInt(shipment.shipFrom.postalCode, 10),
    to_zone: parseInt(shipment.shipTo.postalCode, 10),
    total_weight: shipment.package.weight.ounces,
  };

  // STEP 2: Call the carrier's API
  const response = await apiClient.request<GenerateLabelResponse>({ data });

  // STEP 3: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
  return formatShipment(response.data);
}

/**
 * Formats a shipment in the way ShipEngine expects
 */
function formatShipment(response: GenerateLabelResponse): ShipmentConfirmation {
  return {
    trackingNumber: response.tracking_number,
