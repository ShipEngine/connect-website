Local Tooling
=================================
[ShipEngine Connect](./../../index.mdx) provides local tooling that makes it easier to develop your application.
The [`connect start` command](./../cli.mdx#run-your-app-locally) starts two local web servers. One server exposes your
app as a [REST API](#rest-api) and the other provides a [web UI](#ui) that allows you to view
information about your app and interact with it.

Our tools allow you to start with an application that is runnable, out-of-the-box. You can then debug in real-time as you implement
your methods. When you generate a new application using the [`connect init` command](./../cli.mdx#initialize-a-new-app),
 you will have access to these tools before you even implement your first method.

For example, you can put a breakpoint inside one of the generated methods and inspect the arguments that are passed to the method.
This is useful when writing the code to map the arguments passed to your method into the inputs needed by your backend
API.

> **TIP:**
> Remove the code that throws a `NotImplementedError`, add an arbitrary statement such as a `console.log`,
  and put a breakpoint there. Then use the corresponding request in our Postman collection to send
  a request to your local dev API.

REST API
---------------------------
Our [local dev api guide](./../local-tooling/local-dev-api.mdx) explains how to use our Postman collection
to send requests to your application using the local dev REST API.



UI
-----------------------------------
Our [local dev UI guide](./../local-tooling/local-dev-ui.mdx) shows you how to access the local dev UI and use it
to interact with your application.
