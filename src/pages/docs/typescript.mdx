Developing in TypeScript
==================================

[ShipEngine Connect](../index.mdx) gives you the flexibility to develop your integration application in either TypeScript or JavaScript as long as it matches the required [application structure](./structure.mdx).

[The `@shipengine/connect` NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipengine/connect) is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions to help you build your app more easily. Many editors, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), will automatically detect our type definitions and provide you with auto-completion and intellisense functionality â€” sometimes even if you're writing plain JavaScript.

When you run [the `connect init` command](./cli.mdx#initialize-a-new-app) to [create a new app](./create-first-app.mdx), you'll have the option of selecting JavaScript or TypeScript. Selecting TypeScript will generate `.ts` files that import the necessary type definitions from our NPM package. It will also create a [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html), which allows you to adjust TypeScript's settings.


Build Step Required
----------------------------
You will need to build your TypeScript before running commands such as `connect test` or `connect publish` to ensure that the command is using your latest code. 

To make this easier, we add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

- **build**<br/>
The "build" script compiles your TypeScript code to JavaScript so ShipEngine Connect can run it. You can run this script via `npm run build`. You can also customize the build script however you need, such as passing options to the compiler or adding pre-build or post-build steps.

- **watch**<br/>
The "watch" script runs the TypeScript compiler in ["watch mode"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/configuring-watch.html), which automatically detects source code changes and does a fast,
differential rebuild. Note that you'll need to leave your terminal window running, and you'll need to open a new terminal window to perform any other commands, such as [`connect test`](./cli.mdx#test-your-app).
