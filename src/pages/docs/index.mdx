Getting Started
================

In order to add your service to ShipEngine Connect and make it available within our suite of e-commerce applications,
you'll need to create a JavaScript application.

Our documentation assumes that you understand:
* Basic programming concepts
* How to use a terminal on your computer
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)/[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (_optional - you can use plain JavaScript_)

ShipEngine Connect Apps
------------------------
Shipengine Connect apps are NPM packages that export an object matching a certain structure. Please see [our application structure guide](./structure.mdx) as well as our [sample apps](https://github.com/ShipEngine/connect-samples) for more information.

Your app will run in our hosted Node.js runtime environment. We take care of hosting, scaling, and providing high-availability access to your application, so you can just focus on the core functionality.


Developer Tooling
------------------------------------------
The [ShipEngine Connect NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipengine/connect) provides TypeScript type definitions, enumerations, and helper classes for you to use in your app. It also provides a [command-line interface](./cli.mdx) to aid you in your application development.

Use it to:
* [Scaffold a new application](create-first-app.mdx#create-new-project)
* [Test your application](testing/index.mdx)
* [Publish your application](publish.mdx)
