Local Tooling
=================================
[ShipEngine Connect](./../../index.mdx) provides local tooling that makes it easier to develop your application.
The [`connect start` command](./../cli.mdx#run-your-app-locally) starts two local web servers. One server exposes your
app as a [REST API](#rest-api) and the other provides a [web UI](#ui) that allows you to view
information about your app and interact with it.

Our tools allow you to start with an application that is runnable, out-of-the-box. You can then debug in real-time as you implement
your methods. When you generate a new application using the [`connect init` command](./../cli.mdx#initialize-a-new-app),
 you will have access to these tools before you even implement your first method.


Dev API
----------------------
Our [local dev API](./local-dev-api.mdx) allows you to interact with your application using [our Postman collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/12340335/T1LPBRJk?version=latest)

Dev UI
---------------------
Our [local dev UI](./local-dev-ui.mdx) allows you to interact with your application from a web browser.
