Local Dev UI
===============================
[The `connect start` command](./../cli.mdx#run-your-app-locally) starts a local web server
and automatically opens a web browser to the local dev user interface (UI). You can use the UI
to view information about your app and test your [connection form](./../reference/forms.mdx#connection-form).
This allows you to see what your form will look like as you develop it in your app rather than waiting
until it is [published](./../cli.mdx#publish-your-app).

You can run the command from a terminal or directly from within [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the
`launch.json` config file that was generated when you ran `connect init`. Additionally, you can run `npm start` just like
you would to start any other NodeJS application.

App Info
--------------------
When you run the `connect start` command, the App Info page is automatically displayed in a web browser. This page shows
you information about the data in your application, such as [delivery service](./../reference/delivery-service.mdx) and
[package](./../reference/packaging.mdx) definitions. This is the App Info page for one of our
[sample applications](https://github.com/ShipEngine/connect-samples).

Connection Form
--------------------------------
The main benefit of using our local dev UI during development is the ability to view and interact with your [connection form](./../reference/forms.mdx#connection-form)
before [publishing](./../cli.mdx#publish-your-app). You can enter data into the form and submit it to see the data
on the right-hand of the screen in the format as it will be received by your [`connect` method](./../reference/methods/connect.mdx).
It's convenient to make changes to your form and see the changes in real-time using the UI.

You can also use the local dev UI to test the validation rules you created for your form. For example, you can enter a username
that doesn't meet the pattern defined in your form and validate that the error is displayed as expected. This can be useful
while are refining your regular expressions and rules.
