# Weight Object

Weight objects are used throughout [ShipEngine Connect](./../../index.mdx), such as for specifying the weight
of a package.

## Properties

This table lists the properties of a weight object and identifies those properties that are required. The `nullable`
column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods, and the `required`
column indicates which properties are required when the object is returned from one of your methods
