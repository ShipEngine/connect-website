title: Transaction object
description: The transaction object provides important information about a method invocation. It also allows you to pass session state between methods, which is especially important for authentication credentials.

# Transaction Object

Every method in a [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx) Carrier App receives a transaction object as the first parameter. This object contains useful information about the method invocation, such as a unique `transactionID`,
and includes session state such as authentication credentials.

Any of your methods may modify the `session` property of a transaction object. For example, your [`connect method`](./methods/connect.mdx)
can set authentication information in the `session` property so that when the transaction object is passed to other methods, they can access it and use
it when calling the backend API or service. Likewise, if a method finds the authentication information to be invalid or
expired, they may update the `session` property with a new value so that subsequent method calls have valid authentication
information available.

## Properties

This table lists the properties of a transaction object and identifies those properties that are required. The `nullable`
column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods, and the `required`
column indicates which properties are required when the object is returned from one of your methods

<Reference>

{' '}

<Field name="id" required={true} nullable={false}>
  <Type>[UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)</Type>
  <Description>
    Uniquely identifies the current transaction. If the transaction is retried,
    then this `id` will remain the same. You can use this to detect and prevent
    duplicate operations.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="language" type="string" required={true} nullable={false}>
  <Description>
    Represents the desired language of the request. This property should be a
    string that contains a BCP 47 language tag (e.g. en-US, en-GB).
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="session" type="object" required={true} nullable={false}>
  <Description>
    The application's session data. Any method may update the session data, such
    as renewing a session token or updating a timestamp. Must be JSON
    serializable.
  </Description>
</Field>

## Example

Here's an example transaction object:

<CodeWrapper>
```javascript
{
  id: "6ad41b24-62a8-4e17-9751-a28d9688e277",
  language: "en-US",
  session: {
    id: "sess_184849191484716854941017",
    accountNumber: "10004583",
    expires: "2025-07-16T12:45:15.000Z",
    lang: "en-US",
  }
}
```
</CodeWrapper>
