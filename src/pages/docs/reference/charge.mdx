Charge Object
===============================================
A charge object describes an itemized charge or credit for a shipment or sales order. For example, when getting rates
for a shipment, the charge object is used to itemize the costs associated with each rate.

column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods, and the `required`
column indicates which properties are required when the object is returned from one of your methods.
