title: Register Method
description: This method is used to authenticate with your application.
---


`Register()`
===========================
This method is used to authenticate with your application, unless your application has an `AuthProcess` specified. It is responsible for
verifying the supplied user credentials and establishing or renewing a connection. The authentication information will be stored in the
metadata object and will be included in all request bodies. All applications must implement the Register method.

If your application has an `AuthProcess` specified then the Register method will still be called when a user creates a connection, however
the connection will have already been authenticated via the configured type - OAuth2, etc... - and the resulting access token will be
available in the `authorization` property of the request. Any additional steps required for connecting a user can occur at this point, such
as validating that they have access to specific services and so on. You are not responsible for storing primary authorization information
(access tokens, etc...) in the `metadata` as that has been delegated to the configured auth process in this scenario, but you are free to
include any additional information that should be included in future requests relating to the connection.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------
<CodeWrapper>
```javascript
module.exports = async function Register(request) {
  // Your code here
}
```

```typescript
import { RegisterRequest, RegisterResponse } from "@shipengine/connect-carrier-api";

export const Register = async (request: RegisterRequest): Promise<RegisterResponse> => {
  // Your code here
}
```
</CodeWrapper>



Parameters
-----------------------------------------------

### `RegisterRequest`
An object containing the authentication information gathered using the connection form you created for your application.
 It will contain whatever fields you defined in this form. Your method must then use this data to perform authentication with your backend service.

  <Field name="transaction_id" type="string" nullable={false}>
    <Description>

Return Value
-----------------------------------------------
### `RegisterResponse`
The `Register` method returns the result of the carrier's authentication process.
 This information will be included in the `metadata` of every subsequent request to your application.
