# `cancelShipments()`

This method cancels shipments, which may include voiding labels, refunding charges, invalidating tracking numbers, updating manifests, or anything else that needs to happen when a shipment is canceled.

Most carrier applications should implement this method, unless you don't allow shipments to be canceled or voided after creation.

## Syntax

<CodeWrapper>
```javascript
module.exports = async function cancelShipments(transaction, shipments) {
  // Your code here
}
```

```typescript
import {
  Transaction,
  ShipmentCancellation,
  ShipmentCancellationOutcome,
} from '@shipengine/connect'

export default async function cancelShipments(
  transaction: Transaction,
  shipments: ShipmentCancellation[],
): Promise<void | ShipmentCancellationOutcome[]> {
  // Your code here
}
```

</CodeWrapper>

## Parameters

### `transaction`

A [transaction object](../transaction.mdx) containing information about the transaction and session state.

### `shipments[]`

An array of objects that indicate which shipments to cancel. This array will always contain at least one object.

Each object has the `trackingNumber` and `identifiers` of the shipment being canceled. It also has a `cancellationID` property, which is the ID of the cancellation request. You'll use this `cancellationID` to return the outcome of each cancellation, such as whether it was successful, failed, or could not be completed.

<Reference>

{' '}

<Field name="cancellationID" nullable={false}>
  <Type>[UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)</Type>
  <Description>
    The unique ID of this cancellation. This ID is used to correlate
    cancellations with outcomes.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="trackingNumber" type="string" nullable={false}>
  <Description>
    The master tracking number for the entire shipment. For single-piece
    shipments, this will be the same as the package tracking number. For
    multi-piece shipments, this may be a separate tracking number, or the same
    tracking number as one of the packages. This string will not contain newline
    characters.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="identifiers" nullable={false}>
  <Description>
    Your own identifiers for this shipment cancellation.
  </Description>
  <Type>[identifiers object](./../identifiers-object.mdx)</Type>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="metadata" type="object" nullable={false}>
  <Description>
    Custom data about this shipment that was persisted by ShipEngine Connect
    when this shipment was created. Must be JSON serializable.
  </Description>
</Field>

</Reference>

## Return Value

### `cancellationOutcomes`

An array of objects that indicate the outcome of cancelling the shipments. This array will always contain at least one object. You may also choose not to return a value from this method.

<Reference>

{' '}

<Field name="cancellationID" required={true}>
  <Type>[UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)</Type>
  <Description>
    The unique ID of this cancellation. This ID is used to correlate the outcome
    to the cancellation request.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="status" type="string" required={true}>
  <Description>
    The status of the cancellation. Valid values include the following: *
    `success` - Cancellation was successful. * `error` - Cancellation
    encountered an error. * `timeout` - Cancellation call timed out, probably
    related to a network error. * `skipped` - Cancellation was skipped. *
    `throttled` - Cancellation could not be made because requests are being
    throttled.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="confirmationNumber" type="string" required={false}>
  <Description>
    The confirmation number of the cancellation. This string must not contain
    newline characters.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="code" type="string" required={false}>
  <Description>
    The carrier's code for this cancellation outcome. This string must not
    contain newline characters.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="description" type="string" required={false}>
  <Description>
    The carrier's description of the cancellation outcome. This description
    should not be specific to this particular shipment. This string must not
    contain newline characters.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="notes" type="object[]" required={false}>
  <Description>
    An array of objects containing additional information about this shipment.
  </Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="notes[].type" required={true}>
  <Type>[notes type string](./../common-types.mdx#notes-types)</Type>
  <Description>The type for this note.</Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="notes[].text" type="string" required={true}>
  <Description>The note text itself.</Description>
</Field>

{' '}

<Field name="metadata" type="object" required={false}>
  <Description>
    Custom data about this shipment that was persisted by ShipEngine Connect.
    Must be JSON serializable.
  </Description>
</Field>

## Example

<CodeWrapper>
```javascript
module.exports = async function cancelShipments(transaction, shipmentCancellations) {
  // STEP 1: Validation

// STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects

let data = {
operation: "void_labels",
session_id: transaction.session.id,
cancellations: shipmentCancellations.map((cancellation) => {
const { cancellationID, trackingNumber } = cancellation;
return {
cancellationID: cancellationID,
internalReferenceID: cancellation.identifiers.internalReferenceID,
trackingNumber: trackingNumber,
};
}),
};

// STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

// STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
return await formatCancellationResponse(response.data);
}

````

```typescript
import {
  Transaction,
  ShipmentCancellation,
  ShipmentCancellationOutcome
} from "@shipengine/connect";

export default async function cancelShipments(
  transaction: Transaction, shipmentCancellations: ShipmentCancellation[]): Promise<void | ShipmentCancellationOutcome> {
  // STEP 1: Validation

  // STEP 2: Create the data that the carrier's API expects

  let data = {
    operation: "void_labels",
    session_id: transaction.session.id,
    cancellations: shipmentCancellations.map((cancellation) => {
      const { cancellationID, trackingNumber } = cancellation;
      return {
        cancellationID: cancellationID,
        internalReferenceID: cancellation.identifiers.internalReferenceID,
        trackingNumber: trackingNumber,
      };
    }),
  };

  // STEP 3: Call the carrier's API
  const response = await apiClient.request({ data });

  // STEP 4: Create the output data that ShipEngine expects
  return await formatCancellationResponse(response.data);
