Address and Contact Info Objects
====================

Address and contact info objects are used throughout [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx). Your application will almost certainly need to access or return address
objects, such as origin and destination addresses of a shipment or the location of a carrier pickup. Likewise, your application
will need a way to represent an individual person and their contact information.

For example, the [`schedulePickupMethod`](./methods/schedule-pickup.mdx) receives an [address object](#address-properties) containing the address where the package(s) should
be picked up and a [contact info object](#contact-info-properties) containing the contact information for the person that will be there to meet the driver.

Sometimes the [address and contact info](#address-contact-info-properties) will be included within a single object. For example, the `shipTo` and `shipFrom`
addresses passed to the [`createShipment` method](./methods/create-shipment.mdx) will contain all the properties for an address
object as well as all the properties for a contact info object. This is referred to as `address + contact info` in the
reference documentation.

column indicates which properties may be null when the object is provided as an argument to one of your methods and the `required`
