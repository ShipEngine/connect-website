Pickup Service Definition
===============================================
A Pickup Service allows the sender to request that one or more packages be picked up at a specified time and location. Each pickup service that is offered must be defined
in its own pickup service definition file. This file can reside anywhere within your application as long as its location is specified in the [Carrier Application Definition](./carrier.mdx) file.
 The definition may be specified in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), or
  [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

These pickup service definitions will be used by the [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.mdx) to display pickup service options within our suite of e-commerce applications when your carrier is used.

> **WARNING:** Once you have published your app, you must not change the `id`, `name` or `code` for any of your definitions.
