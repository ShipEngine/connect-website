Changelog `v1.0.6` <small>(2020-09-08)</small>
=========================================================

Previously, app developers needed to install `@shipengine/connect-cli` globally and `@shipengine/connect-sdk` locally as an app dependency. They then had to keep them both up-to-date and in-sync with each other, which also required them to be aware of which SDK versions were compatible with which CLI versions.

To simplify things, we've combined the CLI and SDK into a single package called [`@shipengine/connect`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipengine/connect). So there's only one thing to install, one version number to know, and the CLI and SDK will always be in-sync.



Action Required
----------------------------------
Uninstall the old CLI, and install the new one instead:

```
npm uninstall --global @shipengine/connect-cli
npm install --global @shipengine/connect
```

Also, in your app directory, uninstall the old SDK and install the new one instead:

```
npm uninstall @shipengine/connect-sdk
npm install --save-dev @shipengine/connect
```



CLI
---------------------------------------
- No changes (other than the rename)



SDK
---------------------------------------
- Removed error codes that were only meant for internal use (`ERR_FILESYSTEM`, `ERR_SYNTAX`, `ERR_INVALID_INPUT`, `ERR_CURRENCY_MISMATCH`)

- Removed error codes and error classes that were HTTP-specific (e.g. `BadRequestError`, `NotFoundError`, `RateLimitError`) and replaced them with a single `ExternalError` class and `ERR_EXTERNAL` code

- See our [Error Handling Guide](../docs/error-handling.mdx) for the latest documentation on how to use error codes and classes
