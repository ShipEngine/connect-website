App Development Process
--------------------------------

<div className={styles.devProcess}>

  1. Use our [command-line tooling](docs/v1/cli.mdx) to automatically generate the scaffolding for your application.

  2. [Implement your app](docs/v1/create-first-app.mdx) using the tools you already know and love, like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

  3. [Test](docs/v1/testing/index.mdx) your application locally using our CLI, and even debug it using your favorite JavaScript debugger, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging), [WebStorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2017/09/debugging-node-js-apps-in-webstorm/), or [Chrome DevTools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27).

  4. [Publish](docs/v1/publish.mdx) your app to ShipEngine Connect, and you will have immediate access to an entire ecosystem of e-commerce customers.
    Meanwhile, we will take care of hosting, scaling, and providing high-availability access to your integration application.

Types of Applications
---------------------------------
ShipEngine Connect supports [carrier apps](docs/v2/app-definition/carrier.mdx) and [order apps](docs/v2/app-definition/order-source.mdx), with plans to offer other types of applications in the near future.

### Carrier App
If you are a company that provides shipping services, referred to as a "shipping carrier", you can build a [Carrier Application](docs/v2/app-definition/carrier.mdx) to make your shipping services available within any of the suite of e-commerce applications mentioned above. This allows your carrier to be listed as a shipping option any time an order is placed and processed.
[Carrier API Reference](https://shipstation.github.io/integrations-shipping/carrierapi-redoc.html)

### Order App
A company that provides order management, such as an online marketplace, can build an [Order Application](docs/v2/app-definition/order-source.mdx) to allow your sellers to import, manage and fulfill their orders using any of the products in the suite of e-commerce applications mentioned above.
