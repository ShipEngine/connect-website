## Delivery Confirmation Argument 

This table describes the delivery confirmation object that is passed as part of an argument to a ShipEngine Connect 
Carrier App. 
  
For example, the [createShipment method](./methods/create-shipment.md) accepts a `shipment` parameter with
a `deliveryConfirmation` property that corresponds to this object. 
  
{% from "nunjucks/imports/reference.njk" import parametersTable %}

{{parametersTable(fields)}}

## Delivery Confirmation Return Value

This table specifies the properties that are required when a delivery confirmation object is returned from a method.

In the case of a return value, only the minimum properties needed for ShipEngine Connect to look up the delivery confirmation 
are required. You may provide an object matching the specification below. You may also simply provide the `code` as a string
rather than providing this option.

{% from "nunjucks/imports/reference.njk" import referenceTable %}
