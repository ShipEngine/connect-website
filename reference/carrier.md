  The page describes how to define a carrier service.

documentation: |
  The Carrier Application Definition file pulls all the other definitions and implementations together to tell the [ShipEngine Connect](./../index.md) how your
  carrier application is structured. This file can reside anywhere within your application as long as its location is specified
  in the `main` property of your `package.json` file.
  The definition may be specified in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), or
  [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
