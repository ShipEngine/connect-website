![Parcel Post](logo.svg)
=====================================================

This folder contains a sample [**ShipEngine Connect app**](https://www.shipengine.com/docs/integration-platform/) that demonstrates how to integrate a carrier into ShipEngine. In this case the carrier is a fictional company called "Parcel Post".

Parcel Post is a U.S. carrier that provides its own [pickup](./src/definitions/pickup-services.ts) and [same-day delivery](./src/definitions/delivery-services/same-day.ts) services. They use UPS to fulfill some of their [domestic delivery services](./src/definitions/delivery-services/domestic-standard.ts) and FedEx to fulfill their [international services](./src/definitions/delivery-services/international-priority.ts).

This app defines the [pickup services](./src/definitions/pickup-services.ts), [delivery services](./src/definitions/delivery-services), [delivery confirmations](./src/definitions/delivery-confirmations.ts), and [packaging](./src/definitions/packaging) that Parcel Post and its fulfillment partners support. It also defines the [account connection form](./src/forms/connect.ts) and [account settings form](./src/forms/settings.ts) that enable a user to connect and manage their Parcel Post account in ShipEngine.

The app implements functionality, such as [creating shipments](./src/methods/create-shipment.ts), [calculating shipping costs](./src/methods/rate-shipment.ts), and the [connection logic](./src/methods/connect.ts) that validates a user's credentials and establishes a session.



About ShipEngine Connect Apps
--------------------------------------------
Apps are just [NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules) that export an object with properties and methods that define the application's functionality.

An app must have a [`package.json` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) in its root directory, which specifies its name, version number, and dependencies. The [ShipEngine Connect SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shipengine/connect-sdk) (`@shipengine/connect-sdk`) must be listed as a dependency or devDependency.

Other than that, the folder structure and file names are entirely up to you.  As long as your app exports an object with the right structure, it doesn't matter whether that object is defined in a single file or spread across many files.



Supported File Types
----------------------------
To make things even easier for you, ShipEngine Connect supports JSON, JSON5, YAML, and even TypeScript files in addition to plain JavaScript. You can use any combination of these file types for different parts of your app.

The Parcel Post app is written entirely in **TypeScript**. See [other sample apps](../README.md) for examples in other formats.
